Q1a.c

This program takes in a number of values (N) and a number of classes (M) and creates a histogram with M classes with a total number of N values. It outputs the count for each class in ascending order. The values for N numbers are random between 1 and 1000.

This version uses MPI tasks to split up the workload (N) evenly across nodes, where each node computes 1/# classes of the data values.

Q1b.c

This program takes in a number of values (N) and a number of classes (M) and creates a histogram
with M classes with a total number of N values. It outputs the count for each class in ascending
order. The values for N numbers are random between 1 and 1000.

This version uses MPI tasks to compute the counts where each class is assigned to a task. Each task
can compute the counts for multiple classes.
